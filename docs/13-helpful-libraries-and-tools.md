# 13. Helpful libraries & tools

- FastAPI, Uvicorn; Prisma (schema & migrations) or SQLAlchemy/SQLModel for ORM/migrations
- Redis-py, rq / celery (for background jobs)
- Auth0 libs: `python-jose`, `jwks-client` or `auth0-python`
- Next.js, `@auth0/nextjs-auth0`, SWR
- Mapbox GL / react-map-gl or Google Maps SDK
- M-Pesa integration helpers (custom client)
- Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK

Use these to accelerate development and rely on battle-tested components for auth, data, and observability.
