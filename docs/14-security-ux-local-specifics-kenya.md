# 14. Security / UX / Local specifics (Kenya)

- Use Safaricom M-Pesa flows and ensure KYC and MPESA merchant approvals.
- Use local SMS provider (Africa’s Talking) for reliability & cost.
- Design for low-data & intermittent connectivity (retryable actions, small payloads).
- Simple onboarding for workers (photo, phone verify, brief skill tags).
- Fast payouts will be a competitive advantage in the informal sector.

These considerations ensure the product meets local expectations and regulatory requirements.

If you want, next I can:

- Produce an **API OpenAPI spec** (Swagger) for the endpoints above.
- Draw a **visual architecture diagram** (PNG/SVG) you can include in a deck.
- Produce a **detailed DB migration** (Prisma schema + Prisma Migrate files) for the schema above.

Tell me which one to generate next and I will proceed.
